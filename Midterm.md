# Midterm Project

20% of your final grade

### Due October 30rd to your Process site and in class that day

The midterm project is a combination of two separate (and at this point, unrelated) parts.

* [Affinity Project Research](affinityProjectResearch.md)
* [Design Problem Prototype](designProblem.md)

#### Deliverables for each WITH REFLECTIONS:

* Affinity Project:
	- Brainstorm/mindmap/brain dump of project topic kickoff
	- 5 WH of topic
	- 5 Whys of topic 
	- Assumptions List
	- How Might We ideation
	- Problem Statement ideation
	- 5 - 8 Traditional (Seconary Research Sources) via an annotated bibliography with details and links to the source.
	- Brainstorming and development of 2-3 techniques from The Pocket Universal Methods of Design (TPUMoD)
	- Evidence of your work from TPUMoD
	- Concept Map
	- Stakeholder Map
	- Moodboard
	- Timeline of the problem/situation/challenge and surrounding events
	- Personas of 2 people who experience this issue
	- Brainstorm/mindmap/brain dump of your knowledge at this point (I'm expecting to see evidence of the Extended Effort Principle)
	- Crazy Eights exercise
	- Bad Idea Brainstorm

* Design Prototype
	- Identification of the problem and it's audience
	- Pictures, sketches showing the problem
	- Evidence of Divergent thinking about this problem. Some possible methods:
		- Lateral Thinking
		- Provactive Operation
		- Associative Thinking
		- Bad Idea brainstorm
		
	- Evidence of Convergent thinking about the problem. Some possible methods:
		- Bob Hope's - Double Cross and Circle Club
		- Identify the hits from your ideas and brainstorming
		- Clustering....is there a theme? What is it
	- Research
	- Sketches
	- At least 2 Low-fi prototypes which are ideations of each other
