# Flow Chart

Flow charts are used to break problems and challenges down into smaller steps. You may not know all the steps at this point and that's okay. Yet, you should know what you need to do tomorrow!

Start with your goal/problem on the right side of your paper. What challenges do you have? Are there obstacles? Note them to the left of your goal.

From there, work backwards idenitifying tasks that need to be done/resolved in order to reach the next step. Keep working backwards, breaking things down into smaller steps. You should work to the point of being able to do something tomorrow.

Many times, it works back to the point of information gathering. What type of information do you need? What research do you need to do?
