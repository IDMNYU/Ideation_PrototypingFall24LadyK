Concept maps are a tool to explore all of the aspects of a problem/situation and to understand the relationships between them. It is not singular; instead it is multifaceted.

Concept Maps allow us to explore many different factors involved. Understanding these relationships and exploring them visually can enhance your understanding of the concept as well as to see opportunities for further exploration.

You may not know or understand all of the aspects. You may not have them all at once. As such, this is an on-going and evolving document. Work to go deep as well as to be diverse. Annotate your concept map by entitling the relationships between each entry.

You may work in your sketchbook, on a white board, or using [Miro](https://miro.com/?gclsrc=aw.ds&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=S%7CGOO%7CBRN%7CUS%7CEN-EN%7CBrand%7CExact&utm_adgroup=&adgroupid=140324301065&utm_custom=18258206285&utm_content=668037264395&utm_term=miro&matchtype=e&device=c&location=9004354&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACtKBmk19zlSTaSjdShh7VHP6FKjO&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzcm257yLiQMV-kf_AR1UuAfAEAAYASAAEgIrivD_BwE). The choice is up to you. 

The critical aspect is to DOCUMENT your process and reflect on the various revelations and discoveries. Where are you at now?
