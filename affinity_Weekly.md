#### Week 5: Get more specific & precise with your topic. More Research to understand the probelm

0. Get more specific with your topic. What aspect of your topic do you wish to explore? Brainstorm or mindmap to figure this out. If you are unsure about possibilities, do some research to idenitfy them. Document your process with images, links, and reflections.
	- Identify the WWWWWH (slides) (If you don't know these, do your research on them! Include those are research sources.)
	- Gather your assumptions (slides)
	- 5 Whys (slides) to demonstrate your understing of the probelm. (If you don't know these, work to understand them. Use your research to help you get there.)

1. Identify 3-6 traditional resources (visit the library), that help you to understand the scope and different aspects of this issue. Post about each with a short reflectio of their value towards your interests in your project. 

2. Brainstorm, sketch, mindmap, possible ways to execute your research options from The Pocket Universal Methods of Design. Write a reflection of what you are thinking of doing and how you will go about it. What do you think this will add to your research? How do you feel about executing it?

3. Begin creating a timeline which outlines the events leading up to, contributing to, and/or deepening this situation. (due in a couple weeks). This timeline will have iterations over the next few week.

4. Begin creating a moodboard to visually describe the different levels and scope of this issue. (due in a couple weeks). This moodboard will have iterations over the next few weeks.

#### Week 4: Identify the topic you wish to you persue for your Midterm Affinity Project. 

	0. Tell us what it is and begin researching it by finding 2 sources. Post them with a short summary. Tell me about the value of that source with reference to your subject.
	1. identifying which prompts you are going to use from The Pocket Universal Methods of Design. 
	2. Post both with a reflection on your process site under "Affinity Project".
