# [Stakeholder Maps](StakeholderMaps.md)

Stakeholder maps are a visual tool to understand all of the parties involved in and by a project. This includes customers, industries, markets, supplies, suppliers, investors, workers, existing customers, new customers, retailers, community members and people involved, just to name a few.

First, identify all the people involved in your project. Who are those affected by this situation? Who have active roles? Who have passive roles? Who makes the decisions? Identify ALL the people who are involved.

This tool allows you to spot gaps and opportunities as you work on your project.

Categorize those entries and organize them graphically. Draw lines between the entries that have a relationship and label that relationship.

Start in your sketch book. Then as you understand more, move to a white board or miro to finalize it.
