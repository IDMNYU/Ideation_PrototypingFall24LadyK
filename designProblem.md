# Design Problem Prototype

0. Over the course of the first 5-6 weeks of the semester, note any design problems you experience in your life. Document them with pictures and explainations of the situation. Document your progress and post this with a reflection of each to your Process site under "Design Problem Prototype."

For this mini-project you are to do the following:

1. Idenitify an everday design problem that you personally experience.

2. Use at least 3 of the several ideation methods we have used this far to explore possible alternative solutions. Document your progress and post this with a reflection of each to your Process site under "Design Problem Prototype."

Identify your most creative and innovative solution and bring it to fruition by the following process:

3. Sketch ideas of this alternative solution. Include the context, the user, and different vantage points. You should have several sketches exploring this possibility and iterations of it.

4. Create a scale module of your solution, using scrap materials: items from your recycling, cardboard boxes, popsicle sticks, string, paper, newspaper, plastic containers, etc. Use a hot glue gun, knots, tape or homemade glue to adhere things.

Think low-fi. Use what's around you. [Example 1.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CqDbroBOppu/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng%3D%3D)

The goal of this stage is to think through your design. Are there things you observed in the process? Tell us about them. Include pictures and a reflection. Are there changes you would make? Tell us about them.

5. Create a higher resolution physical iteration of your solution. Visit the IDM Maker's Space and Tandon's Maker Space. Consider 3D printing, machine sewing, laser cutting, etc.

Document your process and post your reflection on your Process site under "Design Problem Prototype."
