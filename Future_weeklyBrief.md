# [Future Project](Future.md) Weekly Brief

### Semester Week 10 | Week 3: Future Project - Articulating, Supporting, Researching

0. Identify your core idea that you will be investigating in this world. Also articulate the other descriptors and enablers in play in your world.

1. Do mindmaps for each: exploring what they are, what's involved with each, what each requires & needs

2. Begin a concept map for your idea

3. Identify 3-5 specific resources that work to support your core idea and/or descriptors and enablers. Look to find materials that links to your futures, making them possible;

4. Mindmap artifacts from this world.


### Semester Week 9 | Week 2: Future Project - Cardsorting, Defining and Supporting

1. If you need to, do another round of cardsorting. Document your process. Remember to diversify your descriptor cards to speak about this theme across the diversity of your world

2. Do a detailed mind-map of your idea, specifically exploring your theme/idea. What is needed for your theme to happen? What does your idea require? What causes all of these things? what are the results? What are the trickle down effects of your theme/idea?

3.  Write a short reflection discussing the developments, points that you are at, questions that you have, and things you intend to develop further. 


Coming up: Gather at least 3 resources in relation to your theme/idea and add these to your annotated bibliography

Going Further: Begin a concept map that describes the mechanics of this theme in your world


### Semester Week 8 | Week 1: Future Project - Launch

1. Read Speculative Everything (see Slack for the link) Chapter 1. This chapter will situate the project, giving it context, as you are developing a speculative future. Do not skip it. Write a brief reflection and post under reflections (if you have not done so).


2. Read over the ENTIRE [Card Sorting Exercise](cardSortingExercise.md). Visualize it. Familiarize your self with it. Brainstorm/mindmap your various cards. Bring your questions to class.

3. Post images of your card sorting exercise and write a reflection summary of where you are at. What questions do you have?

4. Gather 2-3 solid resources
