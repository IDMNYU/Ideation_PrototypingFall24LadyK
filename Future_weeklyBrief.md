### Semester Week ?? | Week 2: Future Project - Cardsorting, Defining and Supporting

1. If you need to, do another round of cardsorting. Document your process

3. Start a concept map (draft) which explores the causal relations between things in your world. You can even begin creating events.

4. Gather at least 3 resources in relation to your theme/idea and add these to your annotated bibliography

5. Write a short reflection discussing the developments, points that you are at, questions that you have, and things you intend to develop further.
