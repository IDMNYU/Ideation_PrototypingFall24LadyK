# Future Project 

### 20% of Final Grade

For our final project, The Future, you will be creating a speculative design project. This project can be done as a team or as an individual.

This document stands as an overview of the project. Please refer to the [Future Weekly Briefing](Future_weeklyBrief.md) to see how to develop this project over the subsequent weeks.

Imagine our civilization at least 100-200 years from now. Things have either collapsed beyond repair or life has become a harmonious dream. Through some crazy combination of wormholes and string theory, you have the opportunity to create a piece of information that will be sent back to the current population.

## Part 1: World Development
Work to develop a future world. **A world that is wildy imaginative. Yet it must be a world that is plausible and probable _in some form_. _Form_ means by some succession of plausible events.** You are creating a world, where, as Hans Vaihinger writes in _The Philosophy of As If_,  "(t)he ideal is a practical fiction". If your world includes things like "magic", you must eventually connect this to research which then makes it plausible.

This research will form the foundation, upon which other assignments build off of. 

I am looking for the following:

* Mind Maps
* Evidence of Research (ie, text and words, reflections, blurbs, bibliographies, along with links to moodboards and mindmaps) 
* Mood Board
 
All posted to your Process Site under the "Future Project Tab"

## Part 2:

You will develop this world and project through the following assignments over the next several weeks:


* additional Mood Boards and Mind Maps (as needed) <strong>  </strong>
* Concept Maps       <strong>  </strong>
* User Personas
* Stakeholders
* Assumptions List
* [Problem Statement ideation](ProblemStatements.md)
* Evidence of your development and research from TPUMoD
* Future Object/Artifact (low-fidelity 3-D prototype), including brainstorming and ideation  <strong>  </strong> 
* Future Object/Artifact (High-fidelity 3-D prototype), including brainstorming and ideation<strong> </strong>
* Timeline of the problem/situation/challenge and surrounding events
* Evidence of World Research -  <strong>  annotated  </strong>
* Evidence of Idea Research - <strong> sdiverse sources, via an [annotated bibliography](Future_Annotated_Bibliography.md) </strong>
* Storyboard  -  <strong>  </strong>

## Part 3: The final for this course 15% of final grade

You will develop a story/narrative as well as a final presentation method regarding your this project. Your final presentation is to be executed. This will require a round of brainstorming, prototyping, research, and iteration. It will be creative and communicate the story of your world.


* Creative Presentation regarding world + your object -  <strong> </strong>
